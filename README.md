# Solidity tutorial

Simple solidity contract which allows us to store a message.

# How to use it ?

- First of all, in order to deploy the contract to the rinkeby test net, 
  you must create an account [here](https://infura.io).
- Be sure that you have enough ether in your metamask account. If not, please visit this
  [website](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby) to claim some ether.
- Then you will fill the HDWalletProvider with your new mnemonic phrase and API
  key inside the compile.js file.
- You can now test it with the following command: ```npm run test```.
- You can also use the [remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to use this contract.
